# ZotDrops

This is the official GitHub Repository for ZotDrops, an community-run webapp that tracks both current and upcoming Petr Sticker Drops!

## Inspiration

Petr drops are the heart of UCI culture.

## What it does

ZotDrops allows Petr droppers to aggregate their Petr drops to make the process of collecting Petr stickers easier for students! This data is managed by an admin, and then is displayed on the home page od ZotDrops. The home page displays a map of the UCI campus displays the location of the Petr drop (right before the drop), as well as the time of the drop and the type of Petr sticker. The home page also displays a list of upcoming dates of Petr drops.

## How we built it

We built ZotDrops using React, Javascript, HTML & CSS for the front-end, and Flask & MongoDB for the back-end. React-Leaflet was used to develop the interactive ZotDrops map!


## What's next for ZotDrops

A next step for ZotDrops would be implementing a user account system so that Petr droppers can register for Petr drops themselves, as opposed to the admin account updating the website.
